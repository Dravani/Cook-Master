Issues to be addressed backend: Retreive data from API, Combine both API so they work seamlessly, Parse data
Issues to be addressed frontend: Create a webpage, add images, create navigation bar, log in page

Issues completed backend: Retrieve data from API
Issues completed frontend: webpage, navigation bar, images

Issues that are incomplete and why backend: Initially we used different API but we ran out of request before it started charging us so we had to restart and find new ones. As a result we didn't have enough time to redo the parsing and integration between the two because the new API interacted differently than the previous ones.
Issues that are incomplete and why frontend: Could't make a log in page because we realized we needed a database but we don't have one yet.
