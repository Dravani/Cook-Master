# Myapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.

## Development server

Connect to this github anyway you like. Make sure to install all dependencies using `npm install`.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` using your web browser of choice (preferably Chrome). The application will automatically reload if you change/save any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Or likewise just do `ng serve` in the vscode commandline and go to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run cypress:open` to execute the component tests via cypress. Cypress should have been installed from the dependencies.
Once cypress opens up you can choose which web browser to test in and if you want to run component tests or end to end tests

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run cypress:open` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities such as cypress and this should happen via the `npm install` command.
